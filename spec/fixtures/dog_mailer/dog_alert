      You are receiving this dog alert about #{@dog.name} because #{@current_user.user_name} believes they have either found your dog, or is the owner of the one you have posted as found. Their contact information is as follows:
      %br/
      #{@current_user.email}
      - if @current_user != nil
        #{@current_user.phone}
    %p
      You have probably also been texted via our Dog Alert texting, if you chose to provide your phone number.
